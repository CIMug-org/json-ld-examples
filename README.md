# CIM JSON-LD Syntax Repository
This UCAIug repository hosts the development of spesification on how to produce Common Information Mode (CIM) distribution that support the CIM Semantic and the W3C JSON-LD syntax as format.

The CIM Canonical Data Model (CDM) is defined and maintained using UML notation. The source and point of maintenance for the CIM canonical data model is currently an Sparx Enterprise Architect (EA) file. This permits the model to be viewed and maintained graphically. From the EA file, an XMI file is also exportable that can be further used within various tools (including CIMTool) that support generation of context specific message payloads in XSD, RDF, or OWL syntax. While the IEC standard documents are all copyrighted by the IEC, the UML CIM CDM is open source with an Apache 2.0 license and the following statement is contained in all EA UML project files:
