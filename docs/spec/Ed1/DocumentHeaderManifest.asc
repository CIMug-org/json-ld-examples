== Document Header and Manifest
The recently approved specification by ENTSO-E introduces modification to the document header used in the CIMXML instance data. It also defined the rules for packaging files that are sent for specific exchange in a cimx file which is a zipped package. This approach follows OpenXML technique, but does not apply the same structure as OpenXML. There was discussion on whether OpenXML can be used directly as this would allow utilisation of open libraries. IOP participants acknowledged that one of the main difficulties lies in incorporating JSON-LD within the framework, along with the need for various serializations. Consequently, the advantages offered by using Open XML in this context become minimal. The specification recognizes the need for flexibility in serialization formats to cater to various use cases and system requirements.

It was pointed out that the header and manifest specifications will evolve in the direction of full integration with DCAT 3 concepts. It is also expected the md:FullModel will be deprecated. This step was not taken just to ensure transition period. In the IOP and other technical discussion it was highlighted that:
dcterms:publisher can be used instead of dcterms:creator

* dcterms:references can be used instead of prov:wasInfluencedBy which can still be relevant for when topology and state variables instance data is referred as part of provenance.

* dcat:version should use the semantic versioning, e.g. 1.0.0. â€“ last item is changed when the change does not affect the result by using it, e.g., change of a description. Minor is updated when items does not prevent the given result, e.g., some extra information has been added. Major is when the result might not be compliant, e.g., items has been removed. This is only relevant when dcterms:replaces is used.

* There is a proposal to directly use dcat:Dataset instead of md:FullModel, but transition period will need to planned.

IOP participants discussed the following issues in the GitHub that relate to the manifest and cimx way of packaging:

* https://github.com/3lbits/Grunnprofil/issues/283[Manifest Specification]
* https://github.com/Haigutus/Energy-Reference-Data/issues/39[Manifest payload naming standard]
* https://github.com/Haigutus/Energy-Reference-Data/issues/40[Manifest instance file specification]

In summary, it is expected that there will be a change request and further alignment with IEC standards. The conformity for new profiles that are developed will need to also test the header and manifest as well. Transition of CGMES standards should also be planned.
