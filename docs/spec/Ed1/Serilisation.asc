== JSON-LD Serialisation
One of the objectives of the IOP is to discuss on different aspects regarding the potential of JSON-LD which helps addressing certain limitations of CIMXML. The topic on the introduction and transition to a new serialization format was also discussed. The introduction and transition to a new serialization format require careful consideration and planning. This involves contemplating various aspects, including the compatibility with existing systems, data migration strategies, adoption challenges, and the overall impact on interoperability. The IOP serves as a platform for open dialogue, allowing experts to share insights, experiences, and best practices regarding the process of introducing and transitioning to a new serialization format effectively. As the topic is significant, there is a needs to follow up discussions in future IOPs as well.

JSON-LD has gained significant attention as a promising solution for representing structured data in a more flexible and interoperable manner. Therefore, some of IOP participants recommended to plan the transition and some of the new exchanges to directly to planned for an exchange using JSON-LD serialisation. There is a standardisation challenge that needs to be addressed. CGMES v3.0 and other standards refer to IEC 61970-552 serialisation method. In order to utilize JSON-LD and transition data exchange it is necessary to develop a standard that describes how this serialisation is applied to CIM based exchanges.

The Norwegian DIGIN initiative1 was working on the topic and IOP participants reviewed for of the issues or proposals that this initiative documented in various issues in GitHub.

* https://github.com/Haigutus/Energy-Reference-Data/issues/41[Provenance instance file specification]

This material helped to understand the directions and collect initial feedback on the approach. There is a general agreement that the direction is good, but there is need for follow up discussions on the technical details. So far, the work was performed on voluntary basis and the progress is slow. Some IOP participants suggested that a project could be organised to prepare necessary specifications and sample data.

In summary, JSON-LD is seen as the target main serialisation for CIM based (RDF type) of data exchanges. It is expected that further discussions will be organised to write the specification to define how JSON-LD is used in CIM based data exchanges. There should be an IOP to confirm the specification and the sample data. The activities should be planned soon to enable some of the new profiled that are developed to directly use JSON-LD as main serialisation.
